            Every day people searches for news, entertainment and other kind of contents. But everyone is missing the ability to search one of the most reliable and trusted source of contents that until now wasn't accesible the same way as others: Radio. RadioCut collects, organizes and makes accesible the world radio contents.

            We are recording seven hundred radio stations, they call us "The memory of the airwaves". We enable the users to listen at any point of time and share pieces of radio in social networks.
