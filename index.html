          <h2>PROBLEM - Alternative #1</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            In this moment, in every small or big city of the world, there are many radio stations broadcasting original and local contents. And this evening, when commuting back to home, someone will feel alone instead of being informed and accompanied, because those contents were lost inmediatelly after going live. </br>
Every day people searches for news, entertainment and other kind of contents. But everyone is missing the ability to search one of the most reliable and trusted source of contents that until now wasn't accesible the same way as others: Radio.

          <h2>PROBLEM - Alternative #2</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            Every day, the people is exposed to an overwhelming amount of news, entertainment and other kind of contents. In this tsunami of information, in the age of fake news, it's hard to find high quality and reliable sources of contents. <br/>
            But everyone is missing the ability to access and search one of the most trusted source of contents: Radio. <br/>
            What is more reliable than listening to stories in the voice of the main protagonists? What is more trusted than the voice of a well-known radio host? <br/>
Until now, radio contents were not accessible the same way as other contents, with search and on-demand access.

           <aside class="notes">
             We make money through ads, integrating Google’s ad networks and with partnerships with audio ads networks.</br>

          <h2>MARKET SIZE - 2 SLIDES</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            We will initially target a market of half a BILLION radio listeners that are also connected in South East Asia, India and South America. And this market will be even bigger with urbanization and growth in connectivity.</br>
            But radio has listeners all over the world and we are able to scale and record the main stations in every country in just a few months.</br>

          <h2>WHERE WE FIT</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            Compared with existing solutions, there are many popular platforms that show the eagerness of the users to access contents on-demand and for sharing and social discovery, and alternatives for listening live radio, but we are the only one that enables on-demand and social on radio contents.

          <h2>TEAM</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            I am the founder and CEO. I am software engineer with more than 20 years of experience, and in the last fourteen years I have been the CEO of a previous entrepreneurship.</br>
            Having a strong technical background, in these years managing my own company, I acquired -sometimes in the hard way- others skills as how to manage people, financials and sales.</br>
            And she is Milena, also a software engineer with more focus in usability and community building. We are based in Argentina. We have been co-founders of the previous company, so we know each other and we work very well together.

          <h2>TRACTION</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            We are storing and giving access to near ONE THOUSAND YEARS of radio contents from seven hundred radio stations in fifteen countries.</br>
            The average user, expends EIGHT HOURS a month in our app. One hour and forty five minutes it's the most common session duration.</br>
            But this number pales compared to the TWENTY hours a month the users expend in our web site, mostly from desktop computers at home or work.</br>
            We have SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND unique users in both web and mobile platforms.</br>
            Our monthly revenues are SEVEN THOUSAND dollars and with a small team of three people we are already profitable.</br>
            We received awards from ETER, like the grammys for argentinian radio, and from ARGENTORES. And (next thursday I will be|yesterday I was) speaker at the Digital Broadcast Symposium in Malaysia, organized by the ASIAN-PACIFIC BROADCASTING UNION.
