Every day people searches for news, entertainment and other kind of contents. But everyone is missing the ability to search one of the most reliable and trusted source of contents that until now wasn't accesible the same way as others: Radio.

          <aside class="notes">
            Every day, the people is exposed to an overwhelming amount of news, entertainment and other kind of contents. In this tsunami of information, in the age of fake news, it's hard to find high quality and reliable sources of contents. <br/>
            But everyone is missing the ability to access and search one of the most trusted source of contents: Radio. <br/>
            What is more reliable than listening to stories in the voice of the main protagonists? What is more trusted than the voice of a well-known radio host? <br/>
Until now, radio contents were not accessible the same way as other contents, with search and on-demand access.
