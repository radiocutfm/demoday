RADIOCUT

Solution: we made radio permanent

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Problem #1

They enable to get continued value of radio, until now radio was ethereal and gets value only one time.

Blablah is a radio show in radio XXYYZZ in India. They go monday to friday from 9 to 12, with entertainment, news and interviews, more than 00000 people listens to them every day. But those contents could be listened by much more people, much more time.
In RadioCut we record radio XXYYZZ and 750 others radios in 00 countries, we make the radio permanent, enabling much more people to discover and enjoy those contents, through search, sharing and on-demand access.



## of people work in radio stations, creating all kind of contents: news, opinions, interviews. They put a lof of effort to create that content, to cautivate an audience that in some countries is more than 90% of the people every week. But the value of that effort is (under exploited | wasted | partially wasted) by making those contents only accesible for listening live in the radio station area.
RadioCut records those contents and makes them accesible whenever you are and FOREVER, allowing continued value extraction over those contents instead of only one time.

Problem #2

Is the world largest radio content discovery platform in the world. You find radio content in any language, local content in any radio around you.


John is a 22 old indian, born in xxxx. He growth listening to the radio in it's family house, as a morning routine that kept the family entertainment and informed. Six months ago, he moved to Mumbai searching for new opportunities in study and work. But soon after moving he felt something missing in his life, something that connected him to home. That was until he found RadioCut, that enabled him to listen his home town radio station, get more news and stay connected, even when he lives in a different city with different daily routes. He filled that missing space he has been experiencing since his big move to the big city.

Problem #3

RadioCut organizes and collects and makes accesible the worlds radio contents. They are like "Google for radio"


In today's days, people are finding more compelling reasons to stay connected to the world. With this constant search for information, it's not a question of what sourcres people can look into, but more of how they access these sources. And, while they search for content, people look into finding information that's easily accesible, reliable and credible. ... (then radio, the most trusted media, and RadioCut comes to rescue...)


Every day people searches for news, entertainment and other kind of contents. But everyone is missing the ability to search one of the most reliable, highly trusted, source of contents that until now wasn't accesible the same way as others: Radio. RadioCut collects, organizes and makes accesible the world radio contents. It's like a Google for radio contents.

At RadioCut, we record 700 hundred radio stations /*, they call us "The memory of the airwaves"*/. We enable the users to listen at any point of time and share pieces of radio in social networks.
